# Rasteroids
A tribute to 1979's Asteroids. The game's demo mode on an Arduino Uno+LCD. *A clock.*

Following on from my previous [ElitePetite](https://github.com/funnypolynomial/ElitePetite) and [LittleZone](https://github.com/funnypolynomial/LittleZone) this is a similar treatment of the attract/demo mode of Asteroids.  
**THIS DOES NOT PROVIDE GAMEPLAY.**  
But it can show the time as the score, so can act as a clock.
Runs with an Arduino Uno and a small (320x240) touch LCD:

The touch interface lets you set the time wih Arcade-style buttons:

It can also run on a larger (480x320), non-touch LCD with puch-buttons for interaction:
